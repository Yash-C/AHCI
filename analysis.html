             <p>Once the data had been collected from the usability test, we then needed to convert this raw data into more meaningful metrics and suggestions that we can then pass back to the developers of STG.</p>   
             <p>Because the responses to the post interview are not standardised into a number scale and are instead unstructured comments from the test subjects we needed to find a good way to display this data. </p>   
             <p>To organise the data we first took all of the responses to 
                 each of the ten questions and put them into a single view 
                 so that we could start to see common themes between the 
                 responses. You can view all the data in <a href="Questionair_responses.pdf" target="_blank" download>Appendix A</a>.</p>   

<p>Once this had been done, tally charts were created to categorise the responses into common themes. These themes had a direct relation to the various features and UI elements of STG. The tally charts gave us the opportunity to create pie charts which clearly illustrate the common themes in a more visual way.</p>
<p>Some of the questions that we asked did not provide a wide range of results as all users answered in very similar ways. While this data cannot be visualised, it is still valuable as it contains some comments that can be used to reinforce the suggestion that we will make.</p>
<p>The way we have laid out the results are based on a question by question basis and will cover all the answers that the participants have given. From here we can see what the most common issues are and provide some suggestions based on this analysis.</p>
