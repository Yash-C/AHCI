                    <h2>Personal Reflection</h2>

                    <p>In this reflective report, I will be writing about how we worked as a team, what my
                        responsibilities were, and things I have learned through this project.
                        I am a Bachelor of Computer and Information Science student, majoring in software development. I
                        donâ€™t have any experience in working in the industry.
                    </p>
                    <p>At the start of this project, we decided to use a mouse for the device, and we changed a couple
                        of times after that because we could not decide on what to use. It was challenging to come up
                        with a question for a while but we were able to come up with one during one of the meetings
                        after having a discussion with Robert.
                        However, we worked well together as a team, we had weekly meetings where we discussed on
                        different usability testing methods, and how we will be conducting it. After everything was
                        confirmed, we had one practice test and went straight into inviting participants and conducting
                        tests. During these tests, we all knew what we were doing and worked coherently.
                    </p>
                    <p>In this research project, I was responsible for note-taking during the testing, doing research
                        and writing a literature review. At first, I researched on usability testing in general, but in
                        one of our meetings exploratory testing was mentioned so that is what I have moved on to.
                        However, after we have gotten the confirmation on the device to be tested on, we managed to
                        narrow it down to qualitative user testing, and I started to do research on that.</p>
                    <p>During the tests, it surprised me how people feel differently about the same feature in a
                        product. For example, there is a slider feature in the website that is displaying different
                        combinations of a timetable as a user drag the slider handle. While I felt its purpose and
                        function were fairly obvious with the prompt displayed above, six out of ten participants did
                        not realise that it was a slider and were confused as to what it does. This made me realize the
                        importance of usability testing on a product before releasing it. There are multiple tests that
                        need to be completed, such as acceptance testing which is done by a fellow member of the product
                        development team. However, through this project, I have learned that to truly test how real-life
                        users will interact with the product and to determine any major design flaws, some form of
                        usability tests must be conducted.
                        This experience will keep reminding me that usability studies are an important part of the
                        development process, because at the end of the day, it is the users that will be using the
                        product.
