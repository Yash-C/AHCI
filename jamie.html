                    <h2>Personal Reflection</h2>

                    <p>In the era of technology where we are spending more time using computers and other technologies
                        for our everyday lifestyle, this was a great breath of fresh air to be understanding how we as
                        humans interact with computers and how they interact with us back helping you learn and develop
                        better systems in the future. I am a final year student studying a bachelor’s in computer
                        science with a major in software development here at AUT. Previously I have been part of many
                        different group projects Such as building an IOS AR game, making a website where users can
                        purchase plants and working at a Wholesale Company developing a website where I collaborate with
                        editors and graphic designers. This has given me plenty of knowledge and experience on which key
                        features we need to be aware of to ensure that nothing causes delay to the project overall.</p>
                    <p> During this study I was interested to work in a new group over a topic that I hadn’t put much
                        thought to personally. We as a group struggled initially to come up with a good study as
                        different parties thought differently when we did end up coming up with an idea, we further had
                        more issues regarding how to measure the idea. Once decided upon a usability test it was
                        difficult to find out how can we track and discover something was bad or good. However, as we
                        have all worked in groups before we were able to come up with facts and methods that would best
                        suit this study and came up with the method of conducting the study during our weekly meetings.
                        We as a group did well to meet up and communicate over Facebook messenger to keep each other in
                        the loop and put all the information on Google drive so that all members could access it when
                        needed.</p>
                    <p>My initial task was to come up with a post interview survey that can be used to further find out
                        more details about the subject’s experience using the website. I initially had come up with 11
                        questions which then were reduced to 10 after a team meeting as the 10 questions seemed to
                        provide the most information needed for this project. I was later tasked with gathering data
                        from the video recordings so that way the subjects can be measured using time. While the team
                        analysed the data, I spend some time creating a website that could be used to showcase our
                        project. Lastly, I worked alongside Matt created the information to be displayed onto the
                        methodology page.</p>
                    <p>I found out the importance of usability tests on a system as it showcased how different subjects
                        had different issues and provided feedback on areas of improvement. In the end the project
                        helped me understand why and how to conduct a thorough usability test and how it can aid in the
                        process of developing a software or system.</p>
