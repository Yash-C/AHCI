                    <h2>Personal Reflection</h2>

                    <p>The aim of this reflective report is to reflect on the usability study we conducted as a whole
                        and to allow students to critically think about the process we have undertaken, discus what we
                        have learnt and what we will be able to use in the future of our careers. Reflection is vital to
                        understanding the why and how things have happened and allows us to adjust our views and actions
                        to positively impact the future. By leveraging this information and learning from our mistakes
                        we are able to make positive change and improve our workflow.

                        Currently, I am in my final weeks studying a Bachelor of Computer and Information Sciences at
                        AUT where I major in Software Development. My current (relative) work experience consists of
                        working over the summer at a medium sized software company called Serko located in Parnell where
                        I worked as an intern. I was working with a team of 6 others in developing an internal human
                        resources application aimed at synchronising the data from two external providers through the
                        use of API’s. This has given me vital real world experience in a real fast moving company as
                        well as working in a team that is completely new together. This experience helped me grow and
                        thrive as an individual and really gave me a step up in the software development game by
                        improving my development capabilities as well as my confidence talking to important
                        stakeholders. It has also shown me that problems can easily arise in group environments;
                        especially when there are disagreements with the direction of a certain product.
                    </p>
                    <p> While working on this assignment, we stayed in our original groups from the first half of the
                        paper. The team works well together and we are able to be transparent about what we are
                        thinking; this allows us to solve problems quickly and effectively as they arise rather than
                        letting issues fester to the detriment of the team. Generally, I find that working in a team can
                        be a lot of work as there is overhead to find out what everyone is comfortable doing and what
                        everyone is good at. Sometimes it’s much easier when you know you need to do and you can just go
                        ahead and get started at any stage without needing the approval of other team members.

                        I have also found in my whole experience at AUT that working in a team means you need to
                        compromise on certain components such as quality or project direction. For example, if documents
                        or code are not to the standard you would normally produce you can’t just re-write what your
                        teammate has written and completely change something because it suits. Saying this, our team has
                        been working very well together and produced work of a high standard that everyone can be proud
                        of. Our communication has also been great and everyone has been active in the Facebook chat we
                        created which has positively helped the group dynamic.

                        When we started this project, we were quite lost in terms of the direction we wanted to go and
                        what question we wanted to answer. We first started brainstorming ideas and came up with some an
                        around FPS shooters and ‘if playing more hours a day means an improvement in hand-eye
                        coordination’ but after some more discussions we felt like this was a bad idea and would be
                        pointless. Essentially, we were going to ask if FPS shooter games would mean youre better at
                        clicking on moving circles on a computer screen; which I think we all knew the answer already
                        and would have made the whole exercise trivial and unimportant.
                    </p>
                    <p>During the assignment I worked on various aspects of the project. I conducted all the interviews
                        with the participants where I took them through what we needed them to do, which includes
                        getting them setup and asking interview questions at the end. I aided in setting up the
                        preliminary scenario and finding the best way to test the application. I was also responsible
                        for the methodology section of the website, which defines what we did and how we went about
                        completing the study which I worked on with Yash. Even though it wasn't specified or required I
                        also acted as a pseudo leader for the group where I helped guide team members in their tasks and
                        provide feedback when necessary.</p>
                    <p>Previously when showing the application to people I would tell them what it does and how to use
                        it without thinking that there are any issues with it. This way of showing people has clouded
                        the true usability of the website; as I have shown people how to use everything rather than just
                        letting them try it out and finding the flaws.

                        In conclusion, before conducting this project, I didn’t understand the importance of getting
                        users who have never seen the application before to try it out while actively watching what they
                        do without guidance. After conducting a usability study of our own, it has been made apparent
                        that what I might think is an obvious feature that no one can miss is really not. Different
                        people have different expectations and backgrounds, and what is obvious to me is not obvious to
                        everyone else. Being able to create a truly intuitive application that doesn't require a help
                        section requires us to look outside the box and into other people's perspective. From now on,
                        whenever I will be working in the industry or on my own projects I will ensure that I conduct
                        some sort of qualitative usability study, even if it's just on my own family or friends.
                        Hopefully, these findings from the usability study will help the development of a more intuitive
                        AUT application that students can use and be proud of.
